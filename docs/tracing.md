## Tracing

Lotus uses Jaeger for tracing. Currently it always uses
localhost and default port (`localhost:6831`).

During dev you can use `jaeger-all-in-one` from: https://www.jaegertracing.io/download/
Start the `jaeger-all-in-one` and open http://localhost:16686/ to view traces.

In production: you tell me and I might WTFM.
